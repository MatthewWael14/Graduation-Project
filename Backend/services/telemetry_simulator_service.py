# ============================================================
# services/telemetry_simulator_service.py — Layer 2: Telemetry Simulator
#
# Background task that streams REAL telemetry records from
# Data_Science/data_Lake/telemetry_stream_logistics.json (provided by
# the team lead / generated via Backend/generate_telemetry_stream.py)
# and feeds each one through the existing 7-node risk engine pipeline
# (services/risk_engine_service.process_iot_event).
#
# This is what makes the platform feel "live": instead of a human
# manually POSTing to /api/sandbox/simulate-iot, this loop replays
# the telemetry stream automatically, one record every
# TELEMETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS, looping back to the start once the
# stream is exhausted.
#
# Raw telemetry record shape (see telemetry_stream_logistics.json):
#   {
#     "discovery_timestamp": "...", "delivery_id": "...",
#     "route_id": "...", "carrier_3pl": "...",
#     "gps_location": {"lat": .., "lon": ..},
#     "current_speed_kmh": .., "cargo_temp_celsius": ..,
#     "status_code": "...", "weather_condition": "...",
#     "risk_status": "...", "disruption_probability": ..
#   }
#
# The risk engine pipeline expects an IoTTelemetryEvent
# (delivery_id, estimated_delay_hours, reason_code,
# disruption_probability, timestamp) — _to_iot_event() below
# translates one raw record into that shape, deriving the missing
# estimated_delay_hours from status_code/speed/disruption_probability.
